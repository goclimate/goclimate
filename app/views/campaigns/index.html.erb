      <h2 class="heading-lg">What is a carbon footprint?</h2>
      <div class="space-y-3">
        <p>We all have an individual carbon footprint, as pretty much everything we do emits CO2 (carbon dioxide). Even though a lot of responsibility lies on large companies and governments, we need to come together in order to make a change and create a way of living that doesnâ€™t harm the planet. The average of someone living in the Global North is 10 tonnes/year. We need to cut this number in half every decade to stay reasonably safe from further climate catastrophe.</p>
        <p>Main areas to look at in terms of your carbon footprint are home, diet, travelling, shopping and public consumption. By signing up with GoClimate you will be able to get a better idea of which of your lifestyle choices emit the most CO2 today, as well as get support in reducing it over time.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-lg">System change and behavioral change</h2>
      <p>Big corporations and governments are responsible for national policies and collective emissions, but as individuals, we are also responsible for a share in all of this. If we all join forces, we can both reduce emissions on an individual and collective level, as well as exert pressure on governments to improve legislation. This is not an either/or situation, we need to do everything - drive system change AND change our own behavior!</p>

      <p>The carbon footprint of someone living in the Global North is so much higher than that of the average individual living in the Global South. Therefore, those of us who are privileged enough to have a choice to make changes, need to act now to get our emissions down.</p>
