        heading: How our projects work
        1: The purpose of all our projects is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, for example by contributing to the transition towards renewable energy.
        2: Each operational year of the projects, the avoided emissions are measured in carbon dioxide equivalents, which we purchase as carbon credits. This means that the impact can't later be undone.
        3: We always pick the projects that make the most climate impact. This can, for example, be projects in highly fossil-fuel dependent countries where clean renewable energy makes a big difference.
        4: In addition to the climate impact, the projects contribute to local sustainable development, for example by offering jobs or improving air quality.
        5: Projects are certified by strict standards, such as the Gold Standard, and are regularly reviewed by independent third parties.

        about_our_projects: |
          GoClimate selects projects that have been certified by Gold Standard. This means that the projects have undergone careful scrutiny, backed by WWF and other international organisations, so that they have a real impact and contribute to the UN's sustainability goals.

          We choose projects of different kinds, to broaden our impact. We look at where the projects are implemented, by whom, when and how. Some projects are cheap and that means we can get many tonnes of CO2 for the money, others are a bit more expensive but then we can help stimulate sustainable development in a specific area. We explain the reasoning behind our choices, and you can look at all the details about the projects on this page and on the <a href="https://www.goldstandard.org/">Gold Standard website</a>.
