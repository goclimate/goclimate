        heading: How our projects work
        1: The purpose of all our projects is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, for example by contributing to the transition towards renewable energy.
        2: Each operational year of the projects, the avoided emissions are measured in carbon dioxide equivalents, which we purchase as carbon credits. This means that the impact can't later be undone.
        3: We always pick the projects that make the most climate impact. This can, for example, be projects in highly fossil-fuel dependent countries where clean renewable energy makes a big difference.
        4: In addition to the climate impact, the projects contribute to local sustainable development, for example by offering jobs or improving air quality.
        5: Projects are certified by strict standards, such as the Gold Standard, and are regularly reviewed by independent third parties.
